This is a working prototype I made
for a possible redesign of the Tenacity webpage
for [the Website Redesign discussion](https://github.com/tenacityteam/tenacity/issues/163).

You can access this webpage under
https://sosasees.github.io/tenacity-webpage

---

If you are the Tenacity Team and want to host this webpage as the official Tenacity website, please consider doing this:

- Remove the first paragraph on the page that states that the page is a prototype
- Replace the placeholder "Documentatin" link with the real link, as soon as it's available
- If the Documentation is the Wiki, replace the text in the "Documentation" button with "Wiki"
- Comment out the "Documentation" section until replacing the placeholder link with the real link
- Remove the file "placeholder.html"
